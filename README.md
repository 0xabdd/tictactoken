# Tic Tac Toe Game Contracts

I build multiplayer tic tac token game with token based reward system by using [this tutorial](https://book.tictactoken.co/introduction.html) thanks to [eth_call](https://twitter.com/eth_call).

What i learned from this project:

 - I reinforced my Foundry knowledge.
 - For the first time I write code based on Test Driven Development.
 - I brushed up my Solidity and Ethereum knowledge.
